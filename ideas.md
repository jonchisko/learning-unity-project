## Spooky 'dusk' game (example template idea)

## Theme
You are lost in the woods on a strange planet where parts of earth just seem to float mid air. All that you have is a flash light,
first aid kit, water and some energy bars.

## Mechanics 
'Slow' paced 2D pixelish side scroller.
Mechanics:
- movement left and right,
- jump,
- flash light usage,
- gathering of basic resources,
- evasion / hiding / sneaking from omnipotent adversaries.

## Story
You wake up on an alien planet in a forest, where your ship has crash landed. Blablabla.
