## Spooky 'dusk' game (example template idea)

### Theme
You are lost in the woods on a strange planet where parts of earth just seem to float mid air. All that you have is a flash light,
first aid kit, water and some energy bars.

### Mechanics 
'Slow' paced 2D pixelish side scroller.
Mechanics:
- movement left and right,
- jump,
- flash light usage,
- gathering of basic resources,
- evasion / hiding / sneaking from omnipotent adversaries.

### Story
You wake up on an alien planet in a forest, where your ship has crash landed. Blablabla.

#### RFC (request for comment)
X thing is good, could perhaps be enhanced by C and D.
Would cut out E and could you further elaborate on M.


## Programmed platformer 

### Theme
You are some kind of a machine/computer that needs to be programmed to navigate complex levels.

### Mechanics 
You get to see the level and decide on how to use the collection of commands to complete the level successfully.
Mechanics:
- movement through "command cards",
- energy, health, cpu temperature or some other kind of mana systems,
- card collecting through levels,
- evasion / hiding / sneaking from omnipotent adversaries.

### Story
Todo.

## 2D platformer in 3D world

### Theme
Todo.

### Mechanics 
The most important feature would be the dimension "shifting".
Mechanics:
- classic platformer movement,
- dimension changing by slicing through the 3D world and obtaining another 2D world (perhaps the solution of the level is hidden in another dimension?).

### Story
